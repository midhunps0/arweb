            Weâ€™re
            the only centre in India that strictly follows a non-donor (self-parentage) IVF
            policy. We
            truly believe in 100% biological parentage. Hence with us, the end result is your
            own blood.
            To ensure that all babies born through IVF are biologically yours, we use an RI
            Witnessing
            system through Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to detect and monitor all
            activity in
            the IVF Laboratory. The system helps mitigate the risk of human error there by
            ensuring that
            all embryos transferred are yours and yours alone.
